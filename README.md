Public pools take fees and control. If you run serious hashrate, you deserve a pool that **puts you in charge**—from payouts and fees to infrastructure and security. We build and operate **private or public Bitcoin pools** with the stack and safeguards professionals expect (and beginners can operate). [Contact Now](#contact)

> Results our clients want: lower fees, transparent payouts, infrastructure control, and long-term operational resilience. [Contact Now](#contact)

## Common Mining Pool Challenges We Solve
Running miners at scale exposes issues that cut into margins. We tackle the most common problems farm operators report, so your pool runs predictably and profitably. [Contact Now](#contact)

- **High pool fees eating ROI** — We design fee structures that fit your economics, including zero‑fee private pools when appropriate.  
- **Payout transparency** — Clear PPS/FPPS/PPLNS configurations, thresholds, and auditable payout records.  
- **Downtime & latency** — Redundant backends, health checks, geo routing, and tuning to reduce stale/rejected shares.  
- **Over‑centralization risk** — Operate your own pool for control over policy, upgrades, and economics.  
- **Compatibility gaps** — ASICBoost, VarDiff, and rental platform (NiceHash/MRR) alignment to avoid wasted work.  
- **Security threats** — DDoS hardening, firewall rules, SSH best practices, wallet segregation, and backups.  
- **Scaling pain** — Multi‑region frontends, resource sizing, monitoring, and runbooks for smooth growth.

## ⚡ ASICBoost: Efficiency That Matters for Private Farms

Modern Bitcoin ASICs (Antminer, WhatsMiner, Avalon, and others) often support **ASICBoost**, a hardware-level optimization that reduces the amount of work required per hash. [Contact Now](#contact)

When enabled, ASICBoost can deliver:  
- **10–20% power savings** depending on model and configuration  
- **Lower cost per TH/s**, improving ROI for farms with hundreds or thousands of machines  
- **Reduced heat output**, lowering cooling costs and extending hardware lifespan  
- **Better margins** when network difficulty rises  
[Contact Now](#contact)

### ASICBoost in Pool Context
We configure and optimize your pool to:  
- **Signal overt ASICBoost** correctly in block templates (supported by Bitcoin Core and pool software like ckpool, BTCPool, Yiimp, NOMP, and Miningcore)  
- Ensure **ASICBoost compatibility** with rental platforms like NiceHash and MRR  
- Tune difficulty & vardiff so ASICBoost-enabled rigs maximize efficiency without rejected shares  
[Contact Now](#contact)

### Why It Matters for ASIC Farm Owners
For operators of **Bitmain Antminer S19/S21**, **WhatsMiner M30/M50/M63 series**, or **Canaan Avalon A1566/A1466i**, ASICBoost support is **a direct boost to profitability**. With rising power costs, a pool that integrates ASICBoost can be the difference between breaking even and scaling profitably. [Contact Now](#contact)
