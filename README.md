# Launch Your Own Bitcoin Mining Pool — Secure, Efficient, and Built for Scale

Public pools take fees and control. If you run serious hashrate, you deserve a pool that **puts you in charge**—from payouts and fees to infrastructure and security. We build and operate **private or public Bitcoin pools** with the stack and safeguards professionals expect (and beginners can operate).

> Results our clients want: lower fees, transparent payouts, infrastructure control, and long-term operational resilience.

## ⚡ ASICBoost: Efficiency That Matters for Private Farms

Modern Bitcoin ASICs (Antminer, WhatsMiner, Avalon, and others) often support **ASICBoost**, a hardware-level optimization that reduces the amount of work required per hash.  

When enabled, ASICBoost can deliver:  
- **10–20% power savings** depending on model and configuration  
- **Lower cost per TH/s**, improving ROI for farms with hundreds or thousands of machines  
- **Reduced heat output**, lowering cooling costs and extending hardware lifespan  
- **Better margins** when network difficulty rises  

### ASICBoost in Pool Context
We configure and optimize your pool to:  
- **Signal overt ASICBoost** correctly in block templates (supported by Bitcoin Core and pool software like ckpool, BTCPool, Yiimp, NOMP, and Miningcore)  
- Ensure **ASICBoost compatibility** with rental platforms like NiceHash and MRR  
- Tune **stratum difficulty & vardiff** so ASICBoost-enabled rigs maximize efficiency without rejected shares  

### Why It Matters for ASIC Farm Owners
For operators of **Bitmain Antminer S19/S21**, **WhatsMiner M30/M50/M63 series**, or **Canaan Avalon A1566/A1466i**, ASICBoost support is **a direct boost to profitability**. With rising power costs, a pool that integrates ASICBoost can be the difference between breaking even and scaling profitably.

## FAQs

**What pool software do you recommend for Bitcoin?**  
For solo/private or lightweight public pools, **ckpool** is excellent; for industrial setups, **BTCPool** is strong. We also support **Yiimp**, **NOMP**, and **Miningcore**, with Stratum V2 readiness.  

**Do I need Stratum V2 today?**  
Most pools still run Stratum v1. We deploy a v1-compatible stack and add **V2 readiness** where it makes sense—improving security and efficiency.  

**What hardware do I need for the node?**  
Depends on throughput. We validate CPU/RAM/NVMe and plan storage per Bitcoin Core guidance.  

**Can you integrate payouts with my treasury ops?**  
Yes—hot/cold wallet separation, thresholds, schedules, and operator fee logic are supported.  

**Will you operate the pool for us?**  
Yes. Choose Managed or Enterprise SLA for 24/7 monitoring, updates, and incident response.
