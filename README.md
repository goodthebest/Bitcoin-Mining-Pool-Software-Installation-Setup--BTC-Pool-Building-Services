## ⚡ ASICBoost: Efficiency That Matters for Private Farms

Modern Bitcoin ASICs (Antminer, WhatsMiner, Avalon, and others) often support **ASICBoost**, a hardware-level optimization that reduces the amount of work required per hash. [Contact Now](#contact)

When enabled, ASICBoost can deliver:  
- **10–20% power savings** depending on model and configuration  
- **Lower cost per TH/s**, improving ROI for farms with hundreds or thousands of machines  
- **Reduced heat output**, lowering cooling costs and extending hardware lifespan  
- **Better margins** when network difficulty rises  
[Contact Now](#contact)

### ASICBoost in Pool Context
We configure and optimize your pool to:  
- **Signal overt ASICBoost** correctly in block templates (supported by Bitcoin Core and pool software like ckpool, BTCPool, Yiimp, NOMP, and Miningcore)  
- Ensure **ASICBoost compatibility** with rental platforms like NiceHash and MRR  
- Tune difficulty & vardiff so ASICBoost-enabled rigs maximize efficiency without rejected shares  
[Contact Now](#contact)

### Why It Matters for ASIC Farm Owners
For operators of **Bitmain Antminer S19/S21**, **WhatsMiner M30/M50/M63 series**, or **Canaan Avalon A1566/A1466i**, ASICBoost support is **a direct boost to profitability**. With rising power costs, a pool that integrates ASICBoost can be the difference between breaking even and scaling profitably. [Contact Now](#contact)
